# hello-world
Hi this is a nice test script to introduce the git environment to newbies such as me.
Good to see that code repository platforms have been online for some time now and available to all to collaborate with others on.
Looking forward to working with fellow gittie enthusiasts in implementing interesting projects and hopefully developing new solutions
or at least better solutions.
